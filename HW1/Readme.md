## CONCEPTS

1.

Idempotency means that the result of a successful performed request is independent of the number of times it is executed.
Examples of idempotent -

- GET and PUT methods are said to be idempotent

Examples of non idempotent -

- POST and PATCH are not idempotent.

2.

Issues related to management of your inventory

- Dynamic configuration properties can be difficult to manage and debug.
- There is a trade-off between releasing the configuration change quickly and a complete product.
- Handling of private data is difficult due to security issues.
- Managing and isolating access to certain servers can be difficult due to security threats.

3.

PUSH MODEL

It's a central management model in which a configuration server pushes changes out to the assets

Advantages

- Errors are synchronous
- It is simple
- Better at ensuring assets stay in sync with the configuration

Disadvantages

- Lack of scalability
- Lack of Full Automation

PULL MODEL

It's a distributed management model where each asset manages itself.

Advantages

- Full automation capabilities
- Each asset can register by itself
- Increased scalabilites

Disadvantages

- Needless complexity

4.

Consequences of not having proper Configuration Management

- Losing productivity when a component is replaced with a flawed new component and it takes time to revert to a working state.
- Redoing implementation because you implemented to meet the requirements that had changed and was not communicated to all parties.
- Figuring out which system components to change when the requirements change.
